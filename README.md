# NXP-FMUMRT6
This is an open reference design for a PX4 V5X flight controller. 
Note that this design is NOT being produced in volume, and we will produce a design using i.MX RT1176 MCU instead.
The RT1176 offers higher processing speed (Ghz) and additional UARTS as well as a dual core processor.
FMURT6 It is still a valuable reference point for cost-optimzed design usign i.MX RT1062
Alternative software could also be used on this design such as Zephyr + Cognipilot.
